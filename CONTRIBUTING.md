# How To Contribute To The Data Neuroscientist

## What kind of people do we need in this project?
Contributions will fall into two broad categories: Curation and Coding. Issues aiming to enhance the syllabus will be labeled with at least one of the two categories, to help you better choose which ones to assist.

### Curation
Curation contributions involve seeking, collecting, and documenting the resources that compose the syllabus. To contribute well in this track, it's recommended that you have some domain-knowledge in neuroscience, i.e. at least an undergraduate-level grasp of one or more specializations within neuroscience, as this will be critical in assessing the value of a given manuscript and the quality of its data and analysis. As a reminder, manuscripts, data, and analysis scripts should all be open-access. It is also desirable, but not necessary, that you have some experience with open-science tools and platforms.

### Coding
Coding contributions involve technical improvements and maintenance of the website, which hosts the syllabus. The majority of these contributions will likely be in the realm of web design, e.g. updating and improving the HTML/CSS/JavaScript associated with the site. It may also include the programming of additional tools to make it easier for users to acquire the Resource

## Why should you contribute?
This project is and always will remain free-and-open source. If you care about any topics in neuroscience and how they're presented to field newcomers, there's probably something in this project that you've taken a personal and professional investment in. By contributing, you are helping build a resource available to all who want to enter the field and facilitating current researchers' transitions from one sub-domain of neuroscience to another.

## How do I contribute?

Here's the pathway I envision for contributors. This is meant purely to be a guideline, so don't second-guess your desire to contribute if it doesn't quite match you.

### Discovery
This is probably where you are right now. Most likely, you either came across one of my twitter posts about this project or you've heard about it from someone else.

### First Contact
This is probably your next step. If you have an account and want to get in touch with me personally, reach out to me on twitter [\@usethespacebar](https://twitter.com/usethespacebar). If you want to go more in depth or have a lot of ideas and questions you want to share at once, make a post on [Issue #1: The Roadmap](https://github.com/GrantRVD/data-neuroscience/issues/1), where I've laid out the general plan for how things ought to progress in the project, at present, and what's already been done. If you want to introduce yourself to the community already, please visit the gitter associated with this project, which is where most informal discussion and planning will happen.

### Participation
After reading or posting in the Roadmap thread, check out the repository and the web site to see if there's any obvious gap you'd like to fill, whether that's an omitted resource or something that could be improved about the presentation of materials. Once you identify what you want to work on, there are two ways you can contribute:

*   Fork the master branch of this project, make the edits you like, and submit a pull request back to the master branch.
*   Create a new issue for the contribution you want to make and, if accepted, I or someone else with access will make the changes.

It's my hope that once you've make one contribution, you'll also be interested in staying with the project to see how it evolves and comment constructively on the additions by others. If you have social media or networks you believe would be interested in the project, please send them a link to The Data Neuroscientist home page. If you help others contribute more easily, I might 'deputize' you by permitting push access to the main repository so you don't have to wait on my decision to make (small) changes.
