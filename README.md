# Data Neuroscience: Learning Neurobiology Through Computation

If I knew what to put here, I'd probably already be done.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This curriculum is intended to be as accessible as possible to particpants, regardless of where your journey into neuroscience begins. That said, we will assume some experience and comfort with mathematics and software engineering. More specific recommendations will be added here as the final syllabus takes shape. If you feel unprepared for any material and would like guidance on where to find material, please do open an issue and let us know what help you need, after you've read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/GrantRVD/data-neuroscience/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Installing

At this point, you should not need to install anything in order to read the curriculum. As material is added, we will update this section with
